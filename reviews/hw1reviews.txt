review: Revise 1

1.
"One of the reasons we would like to make right decisions early is that if we make 
wrong decisions in the beginning, it will be very difficult to fix later on."
If a wrong decision is made in the beginning and it is hard to fix later on, they why 
would we want to make that decision later on? The article says two separate things:
1. Decisions are often made early on because they are perceived as hard to change. 
2. Decisions made early on, unfortunately, often turn out to be wrong. 
Combining those two ideas into one sentence like above does not convey the right 
meaning.

2.
"addresses them..." to "address them..."
Either "He foresees... and addresses..." or "He needs to foresee... and address..."

3.
good

review: reword, restructure, use caution when drawing conclusions

1.
First paragraph:
"was described as" do you mean "should be"?
Understood, but also considered important.

Second paragraph:
Avoid long sentences. Break them into single idea or though per sentence.
Why do we want to make decisions early one—mention a reason for that.
"definitions are not unify" - what does that mean, reword.

Third paragraph:
"For the others" - drop 'the'

2.
"involving in the project" change involving to involved.
"will make the" to "can make the"
"look ahead" to "looking ahead"

3.
The last sentence suddenly makes the claim, this is what they do, so this is more 
efficient. Is that the way things are about efficiency? If what is done is
what efficient is, there is no need to change anything at all in the world.
Use caution when drawing conclusions.

review: revisit

1.
In the first paragraph, that's not actually what Johnson says, that's what he 
says the IEEE definition says which is disagrees with. The emphasis is on
shared knowledge, which will remove some of the concerns you've raised in the
second paragraph, it removes the burden of what one developers things versus
another. Reread and analyze each paragraph in the article to think about the
main ideas being conveyed.

2.
The second paragraph is not the emphasis in the article. The article emphasis
that besides the role in the first paragraph, the architect also keep an eye for
critical issues, looks ahead.

3.
The details in the first paragraph contradict with the conclusion in the second
paragraph.

review: good start.

1. Write multiple short paragraphs, discuss—there's more than one definition in the article.

2. That's one, but the role is not entirely limited to that.

3. End with a conclusion comparing that to which of the two types descried in the article.
