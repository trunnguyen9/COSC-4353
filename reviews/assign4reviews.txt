review: Look out for SRP, unnecessary coupling

Fix red in coverage report (fix or ask for help - don't ignore these).

Need some fixing, see suggestions in code.

Address previous review comments.

review: move forward with the necessary code

We need a function that will take in a file name and return a list of avatar for the sequence. Design that function using tests.

review: change direction

The player now has the ability to take in a list of (sequence of) avatars.
The next step is to figure out a way to dynamically create that list so
the code does not have to change if we want a different sequence.

review: fix and move forward

Don't burden the user to pass list on each call. This increases chances of 
error also.

Move to the next step. Provide a way to create a different sequence each time the program is run, but without having to change the code.

Good, move forward to the next step, with one or two more tests.

review: consider something other than String for form

String is not a good choice, consider something else.

Don't call many methods in a test, this is a smell and indicates we
need to reconsider design decisions.
