review: keep it DRY and follow SRP

The tests for iterative and the tests for recursion do exactly the same, except
on two different functions. Right now, the test class is dealing with two sets of
tests. That violates both SRP and DRY. Split the tests into two different test
classes. That will remove the problem of SRP, but now we will still have violation
of DRY.

Now, we have two classes with almost the same methods in them. If we have two classes
with just about the same method in them, think about what OO techniques we can use.
The objective is to bring the commonality together (hint triangulation) while keeping
only the differences apart.

reduce noise.
Remove duplication but don't put multiple asserts in one test.
See notes in code.

review: honor SRP

Honor SRP in tests, one test should do one things, not bring in
multiple functions.

review: Keep it DRY

The two sets of tests are pretty much doing the same thing. Is there
a way we can keep one set of tests (with a single assert in each)
but run them for both the functions?
