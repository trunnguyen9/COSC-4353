review: revisit the return type

Check the return type to ensure it gives us all the data we'd need.

After fixing that, move on to the next step.

review: Address and remove all my notes

Address and remove all my suggestions before asking for the next review.
Search for "Venkat:" to look for all my notes.

Design so the receiver clearly knows if the result is an error or a valid result.

review: let's revisit the next step.

Make sure the build passes and all tests pass each time you check in code.

Address and remove all my suggestions before asking for the next review.

Let's revisit the next step.

review: let's revisit

Start with test of core logic, push state and dependencies as far away as possible.
We don't want to create classes and load them with details at this time, we can
keep it minimal. See suggestions in code.

review: write positive and negative tests

Include coverage report in the build, see assign1.

Start test on a method, stay with it, think of negative tests for it.

Reduce code.

review: focus on core behavior first.

Start to work with data assuming it's on our hand.
