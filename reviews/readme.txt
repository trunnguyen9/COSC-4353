How can I ask for reviews?

You can request for reviews as many times as you like.
A review will be provided within 24 hours of your request.
There will be no review on the day the assignment/homework is due.

To request for a review, edit the file requestReview.txt in your repository home 
directory and check that file in either separately or along with any other changes.

How can I read the reviews for other pairs?

It's a great idea to keep an eye on the reviews for other pairs.
This will help you learn from the experience of the entire class and keep abreast of
how others are progressing.

If you're interested, subscribe to the reviews mailing list (this is different from the class mailing list):
