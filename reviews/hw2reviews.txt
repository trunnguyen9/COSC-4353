review: Save in format suggested

1.
Save diagrams in one of the formats listed so I can open and read them
for review.

2.
How are the cell states being represented, show that in the diagram (which
I am not able to view at this time) and discuss here.

review: Set clear separation of concerns

1.
Show where the GUI related responsibilities are and also where user
input will be taken. This will help to see a clear separation of
where logic is handled and separate from where GUI and user interactions
are handled. Right now, it is not clear if there is such a good
separation.

2.
"The GameBoard class also will display the gameboard when GameOfLife class asked to do so." This was the concern I raised in 1, it appears that logic is mixed with GUI at this point. Clarify.

review: Good start, clarify a bit in some areas

1. 
Activity diagram: Good high level detail. How is this different from a 
flow chart? If it is flow chart, should we call it that instead of
activity diagram?

class diagram: Program seems an odd name for a class, too general to mean
much or be relevant.

GameOfLifeModel - drop the word model.
Why is nextState returning a result instead of being void? Not saying it's
wrong, but just curious, may be the details in part 2 will explain why?

What about the parts that will read users input? That's now in the diagram.

May be rename file HW3_ClassDiagram_R1.vsdx to ClassDiagram.vsdx

2.
"Basically" better to avoid these kinds of noise words in writing (and
speaking as well). 
"pass the output to the presentation layer" We did not see this in the
diagram. It appears that Program is the presentation layer, but may be
not. The diagram may need some change to reflect this.

"model which models the major logic..." avoid repeat of words like this, instead, may be
"models the core logic..."

"it just returns a next state from the last state upon request" OK, that
makes sense, but should it return only the array or should it return 
an entire GameOfLife (since the boardSize is kept there and that detail
may be lost when nextState is returned). Or should that details (boardSize)
be kept elsewhere?

The last paragraph ("Not only easier...") hits the nail on the head. Really
good explanation of reasons behind the design. Nice work here.

3. I like the reasons presented here.
