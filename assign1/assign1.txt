Assign1: Due 11:59PM June 28

Implement the program mentioned in homework 2. Feel free to change the design based on what you learn moving forward. You don't have to stick to the design created in homework 2, but use that as a starting point.

Take small steps. Write minimum code only to make failing tests pass. Follow short test-code-refactor cycles.

It's generally a good idea to evolve the code based on feedbackâ€”create a little, have that reviewed, and then move forward based on the feedback.

Start really early, like right away, that way you'll have opportunity to evolve code based on many reviews.
