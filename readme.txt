Please use this repository wisely.

Check in frequently.

Do not check in binary files or files generated by the compiler or tools.

Please do not delete files. Instead update them. 
If you delete a file, there are two problems. 

1. svn does not really delete it internally, it is still there.
2. If you delete a file and recreate content with same file name
(instead of simply updating the file), you lose track of the change history.

If you want to move a file, don't delete and recreate. Instead use svn mv
command.

Do not name files with space in their names (for example use SomeFile
instead of Some File).

If you are not sure about something, please ask Venkat for help.

Go ahead, try out your new repository, create a file, check it in, ask
your pair to modify and check it back in.
